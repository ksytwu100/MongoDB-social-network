# MongoDB-social-network

## Description

This challenge is a social network front end API application that can handle a large amount of unstructured data in a speedy way, which is by using Express for routing and using Mongoose
an object-document mapping library to connect to a Mongo database. Create and manipulate data using MongoDB database compass, insert, find, and return documents stored within a MongoDB
database. Use Insomnia to test for API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users and thoughts in the database; create and delete reactions to the thoughts, and add and remove friends 
to a friend's list.

## Usage

The social network application can be used where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, create friends, update friends' information, and delete the user and user 
thoughts which are very useful. The user data is stored in the database. The application can be invoked by tying in the bash terminal : npm start

## Questions

When the GitHub profile (https://github.com/ksytwu100) is provided, that is added to the section entitled Questions.
It is the student's responsibility to include a note in the README section of the repo specifying code source. The application is built with my understanding of the required materials
by attending classes, BCS tutoring sessions, Google searches, and attending the office hours for the solutions to my questions.
